    "At this point of the workshop, you should have a good overview on fMRI and sMRI data. Until now, we analysed individual images. We will now try to infer some results at the population level. The analysis of the images of each individual subject is called **first level analysis**, and it involves the whole brain regression analysis we studied in the first part of the workshop. Once you completed the first level analysis, you can move on to the **second level analysis** which is a group analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the workshop, we will run a second level analysis and, in more detail, we will analyse data from a study of Parkinson's disease patients. In addition to the primary motor symptoms, Parkinson’s patients have a higher likelihood of developing dementia. A number of genetic factors have been linked to this risk, one of them being MAPT genotype, which relates to the microtubule assembly protein Tau. To test whether MAPT has a relationship with memory impairments in PD, we will examine activation levels in the medial temporal lobes, which are central to memory function, while the patients and controls perform a memory encoding task. The original analysis was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458014007982).\n",
    "\n",
    "The participants were presented with a series of abstract art pictures whilst in the MRI scanner. They were asked to commit them to memory. When they left the scanner, they were tested on their ability to recognise the pictures that they had been presented with. Also in this case, the task had a block design (fixation vs task stimulus).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image_parkinson.jpg](attachment:4e745fcd-6e90-4aa3-8059-25ae35a224ca.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "By using as regressors the presentation of stimuli that are succesfully and not succesfully recalled, it is possible to obtain measures of brain activation during recalled and not recalled stimuli. It is then possible to compare the brain activation between recalled vs not recalled to evaluate what are the differences. More details on how this is concretely achieved will be provided later on in the year, in Module 6, if you decide to go for the Computational stream. The important information is that a difference in the activation in the **medial temporal lobes** is commonly observed, and this is why we will focus the analysis on this region of interest and we will study cross-group differences in this ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The H2 allele is rarer than the H1 allele; therefore, few individuals are homozygous for H2. However, it is believed that one copy of the H2 allele helps counter the dementia risk. Therefore, our hypothesis is that when committing pictures to memory, the H2 carriers will show more activation in medial temporal lobe structures that support memory functions than the H1 homozygotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we hypothesise that there could be a more pronounced effect of MAPT in the patients than the controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test these predicitons, fMRI data were collected from 40 controls and 37 PD patients while they performed the memory task. 21 of the controls were homozygous for the H1 MAPT genotype and 19 had one or more H2 alleles. 19 patients were H1 homozygotes and the remaining 18 had one or more H2 alleles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation during successful vs unsuccessful memory encoding was calculated for each voxel in the brain at the individual subject level using a generalised linear regression model (more information on how to do this will be provided in M6). The resultant whole brain maps depicting the final beta coefficients obtained after comparing the recalled vs not recalled stimuli are in the folder *02_MAPT_PD* inside the *Data* directory. Inside the folder you will find 4 separate directories:\n",
    "1. *CONTROL_H1*: whole brain beta coefficients maps for control patients with the H1 allele\n",
    "2. *CONTROL_H2*: whole brain beta coefficients maps for control patients with the H2 allele\n",
    "3. *PD_H1*: whole brain beta coefficients maps for Parkinson's patients with the H1 allele\n",
    "4. *PD_H2*: whole brain beta coefficients maps for Parkinson's patients with the H2 allele\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you will have two additional images that correspond to a standard MNI brain template (*MNI152_T1_1mm*) and a mask for the medial temporal lobes (*Hippocampus_Mask*). The former corresponds to a brain image obtained by averaging out brains from multiple healthy controls. It is used as a standard representation of how a healthy brain should look like. Instead, the latter is a mask that specifies where in the brain the medial temporal lobe is located. It is similar to the brain mask we used at the beginning of the workshop to identify which parts of the image belong to the background and which to the brain, but this time the part that is highlighted is only the medial temporal lobe.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the brain images are saved in `nifti` format, which is a typical file format for neuroimaging. In order to work with `nifti` images in python, it is necessary to download and import a new module, called `nibabel`.\n"

This means that it is impossible to use **parametric** tests, which have as requirement that the data must be normally distributed. An alternative to parametric tests is **non parametric** tests, such as **permutation** analysis. Permutation works as follows. Let's say we have two groups, such as C_H1 and C_H2. We first calculate the observed difference between the mean activations in the two groups. We then randomly interchange the data between the two groups N times, and measure the mean difference between the permuted groups each time. From this, we can infer what the probability is of observing the difference in the non-permuted data due to chance alone, that is, without making any assumptions regarding the distribution of the observed data.
